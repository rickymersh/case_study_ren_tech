# Title
A Quantitative Trading Powerhouse 

## Overview and Origin
Renaissance Technologies is a New York based hedge fund that specializes in quantitative trading using data analytics. The company was founded in 1982 by James Simons who was a mathematician and a code breaker during the Cold War for the National Security Agency (NSA). Simons is responsible for creating the Medallion fund, which has the best track record in Wall Street history with an annualized return of 39% between 1988 and 2020. The company focused on hiring top performing individuals in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science. Today Renaissance Technologies is one of the world’s largest funds with over $100 billion in assets. 
* What is the name of the company?
Renaissance Technologies

* When was the company incorporated?
Renaissance Technologies was incorporated in 1982.
* Who are the founders of the company?
The founders of the company are James Simons, a mathematician, along with Henry Laufer, a mathematician, and Peter Brown, a computer scientist and mathematician. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Simons who was a former code breaker believed that quantitative methods could be applied in trading financial markets. This led Simons to begin trading his own account in the 1970s using statistical analysis and mathematical modeling. After experiences of success on his own, Simons created Monemetrics in 1978, a small firm that focused on quantitative trading of commodities and currencies. Unimpressed by the trading results of Monemetrics, Simons shut it down and started Renaissance Technologies a few years later using more advanced algorithms and mathematical techniques. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Much of the firm is funded by its own employees with a $10 million minimum investment requirement. Other investors include pension funds, wealthy individuals, offices, endowments, and foundations. 

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company is trying to consistently generate profits and manage their risk in the financial markets using algorithmic trading and statistical modeling.
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The companys’ intended customer is its own employees, pension funds, wealthy individuals, offices, endowments, and foundations. In 2021 Hedge Fund Research said there was $3.8 trillion of assets under hedge fund management. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Other competitors simply cannot consistently provide such high margins on their invested capital. The company has mass amounts of computing power analyzing trends and patterns and millions of data points in real time that other hedge funds cannot compare to. Renaissance is also capable of evolving quickly as the market conditions are constantly changing. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
The company uses machine learning to identify patterns and analyze massive amounts of data as well as high-performance computing in the form of servers and super computers to process data instantly. Another technology they implement is natural language processing which is used to comprehend news articles and other written information to influence investment strategies. 
 

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Renaissance is a hedge fund that specializes in the quantitative analysis and mathematical modeling domain.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
One of the most significant trends would be the constant increase of massive amounts of data. Each year the boundaries are pushed for how much and how fast data can be processed. Another innovation would be the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in trading.

I think it could be interesting to see Renaissance offer trading algorithms for retail traders or some other way for less wealthy investors to get involved. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Offering services to a wider demographic could offer the company a larger market share and more funds to invest.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This new technology would utilize machine learning, natural language and super computing to provide their clients with real time investment opportunities or automated trading.  
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are appropriate because these are the tools that the largest firms are using to create strategies and execute trades.
